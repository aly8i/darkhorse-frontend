    <p className="mt-2">
      The board of Grasim Industries authorized a Rs 5,000 crore capital
      expenditure (capex) plan for its paints division over three years in
      2021. As of February 2022, the firm has received environmental clearance
      for two of its locations for the purpose of establishing industrial
      units for the production of paints. The CAPEX in those two sites will
      get accelerated. The CAPEX spent amount is that Rs. 505 crore till now
      on paints, which was mainly towards acquisition of land parcels.&nbsp;

    <h3 className="mt-2">
      <strong>Distinctive advantage</strong>
    </h3>
    <p className="mt-2">
      The introduction of Grasim into the paint sector can be considered as a
      good step since it indicates the company's diversification into a
      high-growth, highRoCE segment from its cyclical and non-core (the
      fertilizer business has been divested) business areas. Though several
      firms have struggled to acquire substantial size in this market in the
      past, it is felt that Grasim has a good chance of succeeding in this
      business. This is due to the fact that the Birla White/Putty
      distribution network, which includes around 54000+ dealers, will have a
      70% overlap between Paints and Birla White dealers, and the Birla group
      has a high brand recall.

      <strong>Kumar Mangalam Birla</strong> the chairman of the Aditya Birla
      Group is according to us one of the most educated industrialist in
      India. Getting a fancy degree or admission to prestigious universities
      given that you have such huge networth and a business empire is
      definitely easy. But what makes Kumar Mangalam Birla stand out from the
      rest of the business man in India is that he is a{" "}
      <strong>
        chartered accountant from Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
        (ICAI)
      </strong>
      , something which can be achieved only by sheer hard work and
      exceptional intelligence.{" "}
      <strong>
        Thus, that is why we among all the Industrialist / Businessman in
        India we have utmost respect for him
