      The company has approx <strong>3500 acres of land</strong>, of which 900
      acres will be used for residential development over the next few years.
      The remaining land bank corporation anticipates that it will be used in
      a variety of ways, including the establishment of logistics hubs,
      offices, R&amp;D facilities, hospitals, and so on. So, as of today,
      management has directed that around 700 crores of land be monetized on
      an annual basis for digital infrastructure, which they expect would be
      used in the near years.

    <p className="mt-2">There could be an interest rate increase of between 25 to 50 basis points in the course of calendar year 2022. We
  believe that kind of increase is relatively easy for mortgage cost to absorb and we do not expect that there will be
  any significant negative impact to demand on account of that kind of an increase in mortgage cost.&nbsp;</p>
  <p className="mt-2">Commodity, building material, and labour prices have risen, and they may rise higher, but the immediate impact on
  financials will be delayed because construction costs in India are relatively low as a proportion of sales price.
  Furthermore, the corporation has already passed on the price rise by boosting prices by roughly 5% on average and
  perhaps up to 6% for the year. Furthermore, the firm has a considerable quantity of ready inventory that might
  benefit disproportionately from increased prices, which management believes to contribute to margin improvement in
  the next quarter to some extent.</p>
  <p className="mt-2">Management is consistently concentrating on debt reduction and deleveraging. The management team is aiming for a very
  robust balance sheet, as well as a large reduction in debt and cost of capital over the next 4-5 quarters. London
  revenues will bolster this management's efforts even more.</p>
  <p className="mt-2">Interest cost in the current quarter will be approximately around Rs.300 Crores and management expects to further
  moderate that to about Rs.800 Crores for the full year in the next fiscal. The detailed update on managements plans
  will be given on a later date along with the sales guidance.</p>
