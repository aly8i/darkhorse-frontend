<p  className="mt-3"><strong>Conclusion</strong>-:</p>

<p className="mt-1">Tata chemicals is a part of Tata group company which is know for it integrity , principles and taking in to
    consideration of all stakeholders for overall growth and prosperity. Although company has huge debt of 7500 crs but
    given tata groups strong backing the risk is very well minimized and to support the fact company has large amount
    cash and equivalents as well as significant investments with huge ongoing capex. Additionally when the stock markets
    are inching higher and higher making new highs it is very difficult to go and purchase some of the stocks which are
    trading at premium over valuations. A small fall in the market can also lead to significant correction in those
    stocks. So at such times instead of buying those risky stocks it is worth exploring this company backed by tata
    chemicals and with a book value of almost equal to its current market price. Book value is based on the value of
    investments as on 31st March 2020 or the value that would have been taken in valuing the assets as on the date of
    the preparation of the balance sheet. However given the fact that market is up significantly from the march lows
    there can be substantial increase in the value of assets if current valuation is taken into account. Thus this is
    worth exploring for long term.</p>
