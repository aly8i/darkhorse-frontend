          Few important points we need users to understand&nbsp;
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        1. When the company's market capitalisation is this small, the
        promoters own majority of the stock, whether it is visible or not.
        Promoters may know who owns how many shares, and they closely monitor
        them to ensure that they do not end up in the hands of others.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. The promoter is the sole person running the company and driving the
        stock price in situations like this. So, regardless of the
        fundamentals or increasing earnings/turnover, the price of the shares
        will rise only when the&nbsp;promoters would like it to. As a result,
        there may be long gestation periods before you can&nbsp;see any
        meaningful appreciation.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. When promoters are enthusiastic and passionate about the company
        and the business they are in, the company is more likely to succeed.
        However, it is not always in the hands of the promoter for the company
        to flourish. Many times, unanticipated situations may impede the
        company's growth, put pressure on the firm, its stock price, or halt
        the appreciating stock price, which may be completely outside the
        promoter's control. As a result, users must be patient at such moments
        and bear in mind that the promoter is doing everything possible to
        bring the company back on track. The stakes for the promoter are far
        bigger than your few hundred shares.
        <br />
        <br />
        4.Last but not least, investing in these types of companies should be
        done as a dead investment or for an exceptionally long duration, i.e.
        at least 5 years. Also, only that amount should be invested, losing
        which&nbsp;should not concern you.
        <br />

    text: "Distinctive Competitive advantage.",
    card: `    <div className="fs-25 mt-3">
    <p >Two-wheeler sales are picking up post the pandemic. There is sizable opportuinity for the companies to grow into these category. However despite high competition into this segment where all banks as well as NBFC’s and even some startup do finance, Shalibhadra Finance has an distinctive competitive advance. These advantages are its presence and quick financing.</p>
    <p  className="mt-2">Shalibhadra Finance's primary goal for expansion is to expand slowly in niche markets with limited competition. As a result, the company may quickly gain&nbsp;presence on the ground. Furthermore, with little competition, the company can dictate terms of credit, such as negotiating rates to shift the scales in its favour when it sees heightened risk of financing.</p>
    <p  className="mt-2">Obtaining finance from a bank can be a time-consuming process that necessitates a large number of paperwork, as well as meeting specific risk limits to ensure the bank of repayment. This is another significant advantage of Shalibhadra Finance. Unlike banks, it can streamline the process and provide customers with easy funding without the need for extensive paperwork. To compensate for the greater risk, it may request a higher rate of interest from consumers, which is usually acceptable rather than going through the lengthy process of obtaining a loan from a bank.</p>

    <p >In India, two-wheelers are one of the most popular ways of transportation. When compared to other modes of transportation, two-wheelers make it easier to navigate through heavy traffic, park, and travel small distances. Furthermore, two-wheelers' smaller proportions, reduced bulkiness, and lower costs make them popular among all social classes in the country.</p>
    <p  className="mt-2"> In the Indian two-wheeler market, loans finance 75% of purchases. Banks and NBFCs hold 60% and 40% of the two-wheeler loan industry, respectively. According to Statista, the Indian two-wheeler lending industry is predicted to increase at a compounded annual rate of 11% or higher. This segment is expected to be valued $12.3 billion by 2025. As a result, the overall picture for the two-wheeler lending industry appears to be extremely bullish.</p>
    <p  className="mt-2">Retail disposable income in India has increased dramatically during the previous 25 years. However, the year 2020 was an anomaly, when revenues at all levels fell owing to the global pandemic. Retail disposable income fell by around 3.41% from Rs 206.75 million in 2019 to Rs 199.69 million in 2020, according to Trading Economics statistics. However, when the Indian economy eventually frees itself from the restraints of the COVID-19 second wave, personal earnings should begin to rise again. According to industry analysts, the Indian economy has almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels by March 2022.</p>
